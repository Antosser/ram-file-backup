* Right-click any file, that you want to save to memory, and click "Save to RAM"
* A window will appear
* Click "Yes" to restore the file or "No" to free the memory

## Practical uses

This was intended to be mainly used on large files, that would take very long to make a copy of.  
So you can make a backup for a large Photoshop Document, make some changes, and if you save it and the changes turn out to be bad you can easily restore the file to its original state.

## Why use RAM?

If you have enough RAM, you can use it as temporary storage, as it's much faster than any HDD or SSD
